I hope you have a lovely day!<br>
Being 25 won't be easy. It means you'll get:
- [dementia](https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/gambling "something you can't forget")
- [balance issues](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/diseases/3909-alcoholism "source of your issues")
- [hearing problems](https://www.specsavers.ie/hearing/hearing-aids "you'll need hearing aids")
- [creaky and achy joints](https://www.who.int/health-topics/drugs-psychoactive#tab=tab_1 "we both know your problem")

Oh wait, you already do!
